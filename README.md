This is an unconventional driving game. What's unconventional about it? Your car's engine.
What's your engine? An unconventionally used weapon!

# Controls
"Horizontal" (WASD or ArrowKeys or gamepad left stick) to steer
"Fire1" (left click) to fire your gun engine, producing explosive car thrust

# TODO:
check if players vector up matches world vector up with a dot product. if more than 80`, restart in center.
